# Koopman_continuous_spectrum
This repository outlines two computational approaches for approximating 
the continuous spectrum of the Koopman operator of dynamical systems

Method 1: using classical spectral estimation of stochastic signals from

Method 2: apprximating the Koopman spectral measure using Fourier moments and Christoffel-Darboux kernel from   
"Data-driven spectral analysis of the Koopman operator"
